== Module 3: Simplify and secure traffic management with {rhcl}
{m3}

With their growing popularity, {corp} would like to add new channels to their existing portals. They plan to onboard travel partners, that require secure access to their flights, cars and hotel offerings.

All incoming traffic from the external partner portal needs to be secured and managed. {corp} also wants to protect the endpoints by easily applying rate limiting and specific levels of access based on systems and users.


== Solution 

To expose their core services to external travel partners, {corp} decides to embrace a policy-as-code approach which provides repeatable and automated policy-based management defined security through code.

The team adopts a Kubernetes-native approach to application connectivity through {rhcl}.

{rhcl} provides Kubernetes-native traffic management in multi-cluster environments. It builds on *Gateway API* (the new Kubernetes standard for Ingress), offering Policy APIs to support DNS management, TLS certificate lifecycle management, authentication, and rate limiting in multi-cluster environments. 

{rhcl}'s policies are applied on the Gateway and HTTPRoute resources (of Gateway API) as shown below.

With this approach, Platform engineers and application developers can collaborate to connect, secure, and protect distributed services and applications through the right policies needed to protect exposed endpoints.

== Environment Setup

To ensure the module can be completed within a short timeframe, specific components have been preconfigured in advance:

. The applications and services are running on AWS on an OpenShift cluster, and AWS Route53 is used for DNS purposes.
+
`{rhcl}` also supports other DNS providers, including Azure and Google Cloud, with Core DNS support coming soon.
. A *Gateway* and its *DNSPolicy* have already been created, because DNS resolution for new DNS records may take a few minutes.
. The partner portal and the AWS Route53 config are already deployed as part of workshop setup.

== Next steps

As part of the workshop, you will also configure the necessary `{rhcl}` Custom Resources (CRs) to connect, secure, and manage the `travel-agency` service. The next sections walks you through the activities as a Platform Engineer and a Developer.
