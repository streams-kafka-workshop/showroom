== Featured products
In the previous module, you generated some user activity events using the Globex web application. Now let's see how the list of featured products is calculated in real-time based on that activity.



. If you go back to the list of topics in the {streams} https://amq-streams-console-{user_name}.{openshift_cluster_subdomain}/kafka[console, window="console"] (click *Topics*  on left-hand side) , you will notice a number of topics starting with *globex.recommendation*. Those are the topics created by the _recommendation engine_ application, which calculates a list of the most popular products based on the user activity stream using the Kafka Streams API.

The *globex.recommendation-product-score-aggregated-changelog* topic contains messages containing the list of most popular products, where the latest message has the current list.

. In your browser window, go to the tab pointing to the Globex web application. Navigate to the home page. You should see some items in the list of featured products, corresponding to the list of products you liked.

=== Simulate more user activity

. To demonstrate that the list of featured products is calculated in real-time, you can simulate a number of user activities using a simulator deployed next to the Globex web application. +
Click to open the simulator in a new browser tab - https://activity-tracking-simulator-{user_name}.{openshift_cluster_subdomain}/q/swagger-ui/[Activity Tracking Simulator, window="_simulator"].


. This opens a Swagger UI page showing the REST API of the simulator.

. Click on the *POST* link, and then on the *Try it out* link on the right. +

If you want, you change the number of user activities that will be generated (the default is 100). Click *Execute* to execute the REST call to the simulator.

. In your browser window, navigate to the tab with the *streams for Apache Kafka console*, and notice how messages are produced in the *globex.tracking* topic. After a couple of seconds you should also see new messages in the *globex.recommendation-product-score-aggregated-changelog* topic, reflecting the newly calculated list of featured products.

. Go the browser tab with the Globex web UI {globex_web_url}, refresh the home page, and notice how the list of featured products has changed, as it is being continuously recalculated.

Great job! The list of featured products is updated in real-time based on the user activity stream. But let's take a closer look at how the list is calculated and how Kafka Streams does the magic behind the scenes.
