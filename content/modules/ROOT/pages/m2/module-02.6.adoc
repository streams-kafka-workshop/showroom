== Quarkus and Kafka
Quarkus significantly simplifies interaction with Kafka compared to using the bare Apache Kafka Client in normal Java by leveraging the SmallRye Reactive Messaging framework based on the MicroProfile Reactive Messaging specification* This abstraction removes boilerplate code, manages low-level concerns like threading, serialization, and offset commits, and provides an annotation-driven, message-channel model.

Let's look at how the activity tracking service uses Quarkus to produce and consume messages to and from Kafka topics.

* Open the KafkaService.java file in the activity-tracking project by clicking on this link https://github.com/rh-cloud-architecture-workshop/activity-tracking-service/blob/main/src/main/java/org/globex/retail/KafkaService.java[link, window="_github"].This file is the Kafka producer responsible for sending user activity events to the Kafka topic.

* Feel from to explore the code in detail to understand what's happening* 


=== Simplified Programming Model with Quarkus
* In normal Java with the Kafka Client, you must manually set up the KafkaProducer or KafkaConsumer, handle configuration, manage threading for continuous polling, perform manual serialization/deserialization, and explicitly commit offsets.

Quarkus abstracts this into a clean, annotation-based model using @Incoming and @Outgoing* You focus purely on the business logic of processing the message payload.

Kafka Producer (Sending Messages)
|===
| Aspect | Normal Java(Kafka Client) | Quarkus(Reactive Messaging)
| Setup
| Manually configure ProducerConfig (bootstrap servers, serializers), create KafkaProducer instance.
| Inject an Emitter and configure the channel in application.properties* Quarkus manages the Producer lifecycle.

| Sending
| Create a ProducerRecord, call producer.send(), and handle the returned Future for asynchronous send results.
| Call the Emitter.send() method with the message payload.
|===

Kafka Consumer (Receiving Messages)
|===
| Aspect | Normal Java(Kafka Client) | Quarkus(Reactive Messaging)
| Setup
| Manually configure ConsumerConfig, create KafkaConsumer instance, and subscribe to topics.
| Define a simple method with the @Incoming annotation* Quarkus manages the Consumer lifecycle and subscription.

| Consumption Loop
| You must run a continuous polling loop in a separate thread and handle ConsumerRecords
| Quarkus runs the message processing automatically on a thread.

| Committing Offsets
| You must manually call consumer.commitSync() or consumer.commitAsync() after processing.
| Automatic acknowledgment (offset commit) is managed by the commit strategies attribute (e.g., throttled).

==== Developer Experience
Quarkus also provides tooling and features that enhance the development and operation of Kafka-based microservices

* Local Development and Testing - For development and testing, Quarkus has Dev Services* If you have the Kafka extension but no local configuration, Quarkus will automatically start a Kafka broker in a Docker container for you (using Testcontainers).

* Shared Broker - Dev Services for Kafka implements a service discovery mechanism for your multiple Quarkus applications running in dev mode to share a single broker.

* Health Checks - Quarkus provides several health checks for Kafka* These checks are used in combination with the quarkus-smallrye-health extension* Some of these checks include: Kafka Broker Readiness Check, Kafka Reactive Messaging Health Checks etc

There are a lot more features and capabilities that makes Quarkus a great choice for Kafka development and testing* You can learn more about Quarkus at link:https://quarkus.io/guides/kafka[Quarkus Kafka Guide, window="_quarkus"]
