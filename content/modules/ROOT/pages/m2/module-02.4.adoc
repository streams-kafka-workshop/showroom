== Activity: Canary Rollout of `discounts` service
{m2}

To enable canary rollout, you will run a simple script to gradually shift traffic from `v1` to `v2` in stages: 10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and finally 100%. The script patches the `VirtualService` on the fly, and you'll observe the results in real time via Kiali and from logs in the terminal.

[NOTE]
====
This script is meant for illustrative and educational purposes. In a real-world production environment, organizations typically use a progressive delivery tool like *Argo Rollouts* which is included as part of OpenShift.
====

. In the *upper terminal*, run the log monitoring script:

+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/app-connectivity-workshop/scripts/refs/heads/main/m2/canary-monitoring.sh)
----

+
You should immediately start seeing log output from discounts-v1 `[discounts/v1]`.
+

. In the *lower terminal*, run the canary-rollout script.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
sh <(curl -s https://raw.githubusercontent.com/app-connectivity-workshop/scripts/refs/heads/main/m2/canary-rollout.sh)
----
+
This will start updating the weights in the VirtualService every 20 seconds.
+

. Once the rollout begins, you will see logs in the *upper terminal* for discount-v2 `[discount/v2]` gradually increase, while log messages from discount-v1 `[discount/v1]` decrease.

. As the script progresses, you can also visualise the deployment the the *Kiali console*. Navigate to the Kiali console using http://kiali-istio-system.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/console/graphpf/namespaces/?traffic=grpc%2CgrpcRequest%2Chttp%2ChttpRequest%2Ctcp%2CtcpSent&graphType=versionedApp&namespaces=travel-agency&duration=60&refresh=10000&animation=true&layout=kiali-dagre&idleNodes=true&edges=trafficDistribution[this link, window="kiali"] to make sure you have the right display options set in the Kiali *Traffic Graph*
. You will begin by seeing all traffic being routed to `v1`. Click image to zoom in.

. Although Kiali will lag by 1 minute, you'll begin to see more and more requests routed to the `discounts-v2` pod as the script progresses. Click image to zoom in.
+

. And finally, all traffic is routed to `v2`. Click image to zoom in.
+
image:m2/canary-k-2.png[link=self, window=blank, width=100%]
. Expected final output in the *lower terminal*
+
```bash
Begin Canary Rollout...
100% traffic routed to v1, 0% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
90% traffic routed to v1, 10% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
75% traffic routed to v1, 25% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
50% traffic routed to v1, 50% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
25% traffic routed to v1, 75% to v2
virtualservice.networking.istio.io/discounts patched
0% traffic routed to v1, 100% to v2
```
. Press `Ctrl+C` to stop the log output in the *upper terminal*.

Congratulations! You've just performed a progressive rollout of a new version of a microservice using weighted routing in OpenShift Service Mesh.

== Clean up

. Close all the tabs except for this *instructions* tab 

== Summary


In this module, you explored how {corp} can use {rhossm} to address the growing complexity of managing microservices. By adopting a consistent, code-free approach to observability, traffic control, and security, {corp} is better positioned to scale its applications while reducing operational risk.

Congratulations on completing "Secure microservices access control with {rhossm}" module!!!

You can now proceed to *Module 3* Simplify and secure traffic management with {rhcl}

// NOTE: Istio's “sidecar-less” ambient mode is now available for developer preview - which meansa future where sidecars are optional. Check out https://istio.io/latest/docs/ambient/overview/[this page^] for more details
