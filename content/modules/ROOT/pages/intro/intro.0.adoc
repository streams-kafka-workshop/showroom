== The story behind this workshop

image:intro/travelzcorp.png[width=70%] 

In this workshop we will follow the story of *{corp}*, a global travel services company that is modernizing its application infrastructure. As part of this transformation, {corp} has begun migrating applications to the cloud. 


Here is a high-level architecture of the {corp} application. The {corp} web portal and core services have been migrated and deployed on OpenShift, while the database remains on Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL). The team is currently working on establishing the necessary connectivity between the applications.

However, the company faces several challenges typical of a hybrid cloud environment:

* *Secure connectivity between cloud and on-premises systems*: During the transition, some critical databases remain on-premises. {corp} needs to securely connect its new cloud-based services to these legacy systems without exposing sensitive data.
* *Granular access control in a distributed environment*: With services now spread across multiple environments, controlling who can access what, and under which conditions, is increasingly complex. The company requires fine-grained, policy-driven service-to-service access controls.
* *Secure access for third-party partners*: Core services must be accessible to trusted third-party partners. {corp} needs to expose these services securely, while protecting them from unauthorized access or misuse.

Throughout this workshop, you will play the role of a platform engineer at {corp}, and occasionally that of a developer, and work through these challenges using Red Hat's connectivity solutions.

== Workshop Modules

This workshop is divided into 3 logical sections which provide a guided walkthrough shadowing {corp}'s journey

* *Module 1*: Explore how *{rhsi}* allows the core services on OpenShift to to communicate with the database seamlessly thereby enabling app connectivity across on-prem and cloud.

* *Module 2*: Learn how to manage microservices with *{rhossm}* through fine-grained access control between services, _east-west_[.red]^*^ traffic management strategies and observability.

* *Module 3:* Learn *{rhcl}* helps you to manage and secure _north-south_[.red]^*^ request traffic flow with   through rich policy APIs to secure access to core services from third-party partners.

TIP: [.red]^*^ In application connectivity, _east-west_ traffic refers to data flow between internal components/microservices, and  _north-south_ traffic refers to data flow between internal systems and external clients.

// * *Module 1* is mandatory and must be completed first.
// * You can then choose to proceed with *Module 2* or *Module 3* based on your interest.
// * If time permits, you may complete the remaining module as well.

== Workshop environment

This is a fully guided workshop. All necessary links, credentials, access details, and configurations are provided exactly when and where they are needed. No prior setup is required (ツ)

* You will be working on a Single Node OpenShift (SNO) cluster deployed on AWS. 
* The workshop activities are performed using the OpenShift console and the integrated terminals on the right-hand side.
* You can adjust the width of this instructions and the right-side terminals windows with the resize grab handle as needed.
* Several components have been preconfigured to ensure this workshop can be completed within a short timeframe. Each of these components will be explained as you progress through the workshop.

The *{corp}* application used in this workshop is based on the https://kiali.io/docs/tutorials/travels/[Kiali Travel Demo Tutorial^]
