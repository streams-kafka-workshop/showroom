== Summary of this workshop

By the end of this workshop, you've helped {corp} make significant strides in modernizing their application connectivity, security, and observability across hybrid cloud environments. 

Leveraging OpenShift, Red Hat Service Interconnect, OpenShift Service Mesh, and Red Hat Connectivity Link, {corp} was able to:

. *Bridge On-Prem and Cloud Workloads with Red Hat Service Interconnect*
+
{corp} securely connected cloud-based services running on OpenShift to on-premises databases hosted on RHEL. Using Virtual Application Networks and environment variables, services like cars, flights, hotels, and insurances now have seamless and secure access to legacy data.


. *Secure Microservices Communication with OpenShift Service Mesh*
+
With automatic sidecar injection and Kiali for observability, {corp} gained visibility and control over service interactions. Fine-grained access policies ensured that only authorized services, like discounts, were reachable by authorized services, reinforcing zero-trust principles.


. *Adopt Progressive Delivery for Safer Releases*
+
Using canary deployments, {corp} gradually rolled out new versions of the discounts service, closely monitoring behavior and traffic with Kiali. This reduced risk and increased confidence in production changes.


. *Simplify External Access with Red Hat Connectivity Link*
+
Platform engineers implemented secure Gateways with DNS, TLS, authentication, and rate limiting. Developers defined HTTPRoutes and applied custom policies to expose services safely to external partners, without compromising core systems.


. *Enable Proactive Observability with Grafana Dashboards*
+
Tailored Grafana dashboards provided real-time visibility into API performance, latency, and system health. These insights supported operational, development, and business teams in managing and improving the application stack.


With these enhancements, {corp} is better equipped to operate securely and efficiently across hybrid environments, ready for growth, innovation, and future integrations.
