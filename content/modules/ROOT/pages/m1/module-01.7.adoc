== Kafka Basics - Topic Replication and Fault Tolerance
Kafka's fault tolerance is fundamentally built upon its topic replication mechanism, ensuring data durability and high availability in the event of broker failures.

Here's how it works:

• Topics and Partitions: Data in Kafka is organized into topics, which are further divided into partitions. Each partition is essentially an ordered, append-only commit log.

• Replicas (Leader and Followers): For each partition, Kafka maintains multiple copies called replicas, distributed across different Kafka brokers.
    ◦ One replica is designated as the leader. All produce and consume requests for that partition are handled exclusively by its leader to ensure strong consistency and message ordering.
    ◦ The other replicas are followers. Their sole responsibility is to diligently replicate messages from the leader to stay up-to-date. 


Let's see this in action



. In the *upper terminal*, create new topic with replication factor of 3
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc run -n kafka-{user_name} topic-create-rf3 --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/amq-streams/kafka-40-rhel9:3.0.0 -- \
  bash -lc '/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-topics.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --create --topic replicated --partitions 3 --replication-factor 3'
----

. Navigate to the https://amq-streams-console-{user_name}.{openshift_cluster_subdomain}/kafka[streams console, window="console"] > topics > replicated and verify that the topic `replicated` is created with 3 partitions

. Click on the topic name `replicated` and navigate to the partitions tab to view the details of the topic. You will see that each partition has 3 replicas and one of them is the leader and other two are replicas.

. The number shown in the brackets is the broker id. In this case, we have 3 brokers with ids 0, 1 and 2. Each partition has one leader and two followers (replicas). The leader handles all the read and write requests for that partition while the followers replicate data from the leader to ensure fault tolerance.

. If the leader broker goes down, one of the followers will be automatically elected as the new leader to ensure high availability. This ensures that Producers and consumers, which continue to operate without interruption.
