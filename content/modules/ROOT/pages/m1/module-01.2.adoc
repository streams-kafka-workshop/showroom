== Kafka Basics - Partitions (how Kafka scales & orders)

A topic is split into partitions, each an ordered, append-only log. Partitions enable parallelism and throughput.

=== Ordering rule

Strict order exists within a partition.

No global order across a topic — if you need order for a key (e.g., userId), ensure all events for that key go to the same partition.

=== Offsets

Each record in a partition has a monotonically increasing offset (0, 1, 2…). Offsets are the consumer’s “cursor”.

=== Replication & durability

Each partition has one leader and replicas (followers).

Replication factor (e.g., 3) determines durability and availability.

Producers/consumers talk to the leader; followers keep up via replication.



=== Key-based routing

With a key, the producer’s partitioner routes records with the same key to the same partition → per-key order.

With no key, producers distribute across partitions and order is not guaranteed.
