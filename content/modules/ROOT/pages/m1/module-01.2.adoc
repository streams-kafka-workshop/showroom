== Activity: Set up {rhsi} on RHEL
{m1}

Similar to the OpenShift site, you will set up the site and routers on RHEL using the {rhsi} command line interface.

=== Login in to RHEL and validate the enviroment

. You need to SSH into the on-prem RHEL machine using the built-in Terminal to the right. 
+

. Log in to the RHEL machine using the following command.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
ssh -o ServerAliveInterval=60 -o ServerAliveCountMax=60 lab-user@{rhel_hostname}
----


. Type `yes` and hit enter if prompted by the message `Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no/fingerprint)?`

. Ignore the *Failed to add the host to the list of known hosts (/data/.ssh/known_hosts).* message

. Enter your password `{rhel_ssh_password}` when prompted and press *Enter*.
+
You should now be logged into the RHEL machine. Let's see how we can set up a link between the database and the OpenShift cluster.
+

. Enter the following command to clear the *RHEL terminal (lower terminal)*
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
clear
----

. To verify if the database is running on the RHEL machine, run the following command from the *RHEL terminal (lower terminal)*.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
podman ps
----

. You should see an output like the one below.
+
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
CONTAINER ID   IMAGE        COMMAND   CREATED   STATUS    PORTS    NAMES 
3d12164dd54b  quay.io/kiali/demo_travels_mysqldb:v1  --default-authent...  4 hours ago  Up 4 hours  0.0.0.0:3306->3306/tcp, 3306/tcp, 33060/tcp  travels-mysqldb
----
+
[CAUTION]
====
If the output returns an empty list, it indicates that the database is not running on the RHEL machine. Run the following command in the *lower terminal* to restart the database. 

[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
podman restart travels-mysqldb
----

Run the following command again to validate that the database is indeed running now.
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
podman ps
----

====

=== Create {rhsi} Site

. In the *RHEL terminal (lower terminal)*, run the following command to create a site. Similar to the OpenShift site, this will set up the VAN routers.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
export SKUPPER_PLATFORM=podman
skupper site create rhel
----

. You should see the following output.
+
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
File written to /home/lab-user/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/resources/sites/rhel.yaml
----

=== Create a connector

. Next, let's learn what a connector is.
+
[.concept]
.What is a connector?
****
A connector links a local workload to listeners in remote sites using routing keys. On Kubernetes, it typically uses a pod selector; on Docker, Podman, and Linux, it uses host and port specifications. The routing key is a string identifier that binds the connector to matching listeners in remote sites.
****

. In the same *RHEL terminal (lower terminal)* , run the following command to create a connector.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
skupper connector create mysqldb 3306 --host 127.0.0.1 -r appconn
----

. You should see the following output.
+
[source,sh,subs=attributes+]
----
File written to /home/lab-user/.local/share/skupper/namespaces/default/input/resources/connectors/mysqldb.yaml
----


== Visualise set up on {rhsi} Network Console

Before proceeding to the final step of creating the Virtual Application Network, navigate to the https://skupper-network-observer-travel-db.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[Service Interconnect Network Console, window="network-console"] to visualize what the Virtual Application Network based on the configuration you've set up so far.

. Click on *Log in with OpenShift*, and log in with username `admin` and password `{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password}` if prompted.

. Click *Allow selected permissions*.
+
image::m1/allow_permission.png[]

. You should only be able to see the OpenShift cluster (travel-db namespace). This is because the RHEL on-prem machine is not yet part of the Virtual Application Network.
