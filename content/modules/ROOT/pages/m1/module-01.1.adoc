== Activity: Setting up the site on OpenShift
You can set up Virtual Application Networks with Red Hat Service Interconnect by either using the command line interface or the OpenShift operator. In this exercise, we'll use the operator on the OpenShift cluster and the command line interface on the RHEL side to explore both options. 

. First lets try to access our travels service and see if all our microservices have access to the database. We'll use the built-in terminal to the right of your screen. 


. In the *first terminal (upper terminal)*, log in to the OpenShift cluster using the command below.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc login -u admin -p {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password} https://172.30.0.1:443
----

. Type `y` when you are prompted with *Use insecure connections? (y/n):*

. You should see a `Login successful.` message

. From the *OpenShift Terminal (upper terminal)*, run the following to check if the travels service and all other services are able to access the on-prem database.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
curl travels.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/travels/Prague
----

. You will get a *{"error":"Travel Quote for Prague not found"}* message indicating that the database is not accessible. Let's set up the Virtual Application Network using Red Hat Service Interconnect in the subsequent steps to help our services access the database on-premises.

. Navigate to the {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/k8s/cluster/projects/travel-db/openshift-site-plugin[OpenShift Console, window="console"] and log in as username `admin` and password `{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_admin_password}`

. Navigate to Home -> Projects -> travel-db
+

. From the `travel-db` project, click on the *Service Interconnect tab* or click on this  {ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_console_url}/k8s/cluster/projects/travel-db/openshift-site-plugin[link, window="console"] to navigate directly.
. Click on *Create site*.

[.concept]
.What is a site?
****
A site represents a particular location and a particular platform. It's a place where you have real running workloads. Each site contains an application service router to communicate with local workloads and forward to peers in remote sites.
****
. Keep the default values. The *Enable link access* is checked, indicating that this site will allow ingress connections from other sites.  Click on *Submit* to set up the VAN routers in the `travel-db` namespace. 
+

.What is a router?
****
Layer 7 application routers form the backbone of a VAN in the same way that conventional network routers form the backbone of a VPN. However, instead of routing IP packets between network endpoints, Layer 7 application routers route messages between application endpoints (called Layer 7 application addresses).
****


. You will see a message similar to the one shown below, indicating that the *Service Interconnect routers* are being created. In a few seconds, the warning message will disappear, and the site will be created.
+

. The warning message disappears once the site is created.
+

. After the site creation is complete, click on the *Deploy Network Console* button to visualize the network later. This will take a few seconds to load. Proceed to the next steps while this gets deployed.
+

. In the next step, you will create a *listener*. 
+
[.concept]
.What is a Listener?
****
A listener binds a local connection endpoint to connectors in remote sites. Listeners and connectors are matched using routing keys. Each listener has an associated connection endpoint and routing key. The connection endpoint exposes a host and port for accepting connections from local clients. The routing key is a string identifier that binds the listener to connectors in remote sites. On Kubernetes, a listener is implemented as a Service. On Docker, Podman, and Linux, it is a listening socket bound to a local network interface.
****

. Click on *Create listener*. This sets up the listeners in the namespace.
+
image::m1/listener_button.png[]

. Input the following details and *Submit*
** *Name*: `mysqldb`
** *Port*: `3306`
** *Routing key*: `appconn`
** *Host*: `mysqldb`
** *TLS secret*: leave this blank for now, as you will instead create a token at a later step.
+
image::m1/listener_form.png[]

. Next, let us learn what an Access Token is and create one.
+
[.concept]
.What is a token?
****
An access token is a short-lived credential used to create the link. An access token contains the URL and secret code of a corresponding access grant. Access tokens are issued from access grants. A grant issues zero or more tokens. Tokens are redeemed for links.
Access tokens have limited redemptions and limited lifespans. By default, they can be redeemed only once, and they expire 15 minutes after being issued. You can set custom limits by configuring the access grant.
****
+

. Click on *Generate a token*
+
image::m1/token_button.png[]

. In the *Configuration* step, enter the following values, and click the *Create* button.
** *FileName*: `my-grant`
** *Redemptions*: `1`
** *Code*: leave this blank
** *Valid for*: `60 minutes`
+

. You will be presented with the *Create token - How to* step. 
.. You can ignore the rest of the steps since you will use a script to directly convert and transfer it to the on-premises RHEL machine.
.. If you would like to inspect how the token looks like, you can download and open the file. 
.. Click on *Done*.
