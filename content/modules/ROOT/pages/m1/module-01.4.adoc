== Activity: Verify database access from services
{m1}

You are now ready to  verify if the travels services is now able to access the database. The travesls services have already been configured to to connnect to the {rhsi} Listener on OpenShift, which serves as a virtual endpoint for the actual on-premises database.

. In the *OpenShift terminal (upper terminal)*, to get a travel quote for the city Prague. Run the following to check if the travels services and all other services are able to access the on-prem database. 
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
curl travels.travel-agency.svc.cluster.local:8000/travels/Prague | jq
----

. You should see a response with cars, hotels, flights, and insurances returned from the database indicating that the services are able to access the database.

== Optional: Explore Network Console

. Return to the https://skupper-network-observer-travel-db.{ocp_cluster_openshift_cluster_ingress_domain}/[Service Interconnect Network Console, window="network-console"] and refresh the browser tab. Verify that the RHEL machine is now part of the Virtual Application Network.

. Feel free to check the different options in the Service Interconnect Network Console such as Services, Sites, Components, and Processes to get a better understanding of the Virtual Application Network and some traffic related analytics. 

== Next steps for {corp}
If and when {corp} decides to add a database replica to a different environment or cluster, they can simply add it to the existing Virtual Application Network and link it to the same listener on OpenShift. Red Hat Service Interconnect will automatically handle failover and load balancing between the database instances.


== Clean up
. Log out of the **RHEL machine** (lower terminal) using the following command.
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
exit
----
+
Output:
+
[source,sh]
----
logout
Connection to rhel.l64pg-1.sandbox3928.opentlc.com closed.
----
. Close all the tabs except for this *instructions* tab 

== Summary

Congratulations! You have successfully learnt how to use {rhsi} to securely bridge on-prem and cloud workloads with minimal time and complexity. 

Proceed to the next module to learn how to secure the communication between your microservices with {rhossm}.

// optional modules section
// You can now proceed to either of the following modules

// * xref:../m2/module-02.0.adoc[Module 2] - Secure microservices access control with Red Hat OpenShift Service Mesh
// * xref:../m3/module-03.0.adoc[Module 3] - Simplify and secure traffic management with Red Hat Connectivity Link
