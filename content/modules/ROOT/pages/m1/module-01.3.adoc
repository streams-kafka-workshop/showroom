== Kafka Basics - Producer (how data gets into Kafka)

A Kafka Producer is a client application responsible for writing data to a Kafka cluster. These applications send messages, which are typically key-value pairs, into topics within the Kafka cluster. In short, producers are a flexible and powerful way to send data to Kafka while abstracting away much of the underlying complexities

=== Core Functionality and API:
* API: Producers interact with Kafka through the KafkaProducer API. Producers can be in written in a variety of languages such as Java,  Python, Go, JavaScript, and .NET.

* Producers publish messages to a topic, which appends each message to the end of a partition. 

=== Running the Producer
* Run the basic producer in the *upper terminal*
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc run -n kafka-{user_name} demo-producer --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/amq-streams/kafka-40-rhel9:3.0.0 -- \
  bash -lc '/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic demo'
----

* Type the below messages as soon as the producer is ready in the *upper terminal*. The producer is ready when you see the `>` prompt. Each line you type is sent as a separate message to the Kafka topic `demo`. Type each word and hit enter.
+
** `welcome`
** `to`
** `the`
** `kafka`
** `workshop`
** `enjoy!`

// * Hit `Ctrl + C` followed by `Enter` in the *upper terminal* to stop the producer after sending the messages.

* Navigate to the https://amq-streams-console-{user_name}.{openshift_cluster_subdomain}/kafka[streams console, window="_amqstreams"] *topics > demo* to see the messages you sent.

* The messages you sent from the producer are successfully received and stored in the Kafka topic `demo`.
