== Kafka Basics - Producer (how data gets into Kafka)

A Kafka Producer is a client application responsible for writing data to a Kafka cluster. These applications send messages, which are typically key-value pairs, into topics within the Kafka cluster. Any application that sends data to Kafka, such as a microservice, an Internet of Things (IoT) device, or a data pipeline, is considered a producer. Producers are how data gets into Kafka 

=== Core Functionality and API:
â€¢ API: Producers interact with Kafka through the KafkaProducer API. Producers can be in written in a variety of languages such as Java,  Python, Go, JavaScript, and .NET.


Producers publish messages to a topic, which appends each message to the end of a partition. When a producer sends a message:
- If a key is provided, Kafka uses its hash to choose the partition.
- If no key is provided, Kafka distributes messages evenly (round-robin) across partitions.

Kafka guarantees that as long as no new partitions are added, elements with the same key are stored in the same partition.

In short, producers area flexible and powerful way to send data efficiently and reliably while abstracting away much of the underlying distributed system complexities


. Run the basic producer in the upper terminal
+
[source,sh,role="execute",subs=attributes+]
----
oc run -n kafka-{user_name} demo-producer --rm -it --restart=Never \
  --image=registry.redhat.io/amq-streams/kafka-40-rhel9:3.0.0 -- \
  bash -lc '/opt/kafka/bin/kafka-console-producer.sh --bootstrap-server kafka-kafka-bootstrap:9092 --topic demo'
----

. Type the below messages as soon as the producer is ready in the upper terminal. Each line you type is sent as a separate message to the Kafka topic `demo`.
+
** `welcome`
** `to`
** `the`
** `kafka`
** `workshop`
** `enjoy!`
