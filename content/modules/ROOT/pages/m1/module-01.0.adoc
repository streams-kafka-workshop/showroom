=== Kafka Basics - What is a Kafka Cluster?

A Kafka cluster is the whole distributed system that stores and moves your events. It’s made up of multiple Kafka processes with specific roles:

Controllers (KRaft): keep the cluster’s metadata (what topics/partitions exist, which broker leads which partition, etc.) and run leader elections.

Brokers: store data and serve client traffic .

=== Why clusters matter:

* Scalability: add more brokers → more throughput and storage.

* Fault tolerance: replicate partitions across brokers so a node loss doesn’t lose data or availability.

* Central bootstrap: clients connect to a single “bootstrap” address (e.g., my-kafka-kafka-bootstrap:9092) and discover the rest.

* In OpenShift/AMQ Streams with KRaft + Node Pools:

** The Kafka CR defines cluster-wide settings (Kafka version, listeners, configs).

** KafkaNodePool CRs create sets of controller nodes and broker nodes.

== Kafka Basics - What is a Kafka Broker?

A broker is one Kafka server process that:

* Stores topic partitions on disk (append-only logs, with retention policies).

* Handles produce (writes) and consume (reads) requests.

* Replicates partitions to/from peers; one broker is the leader for a partition, others are followers (when replication factor > 1).
